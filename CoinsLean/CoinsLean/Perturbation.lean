  Perturbation.lean — Section 4 of the manuscript: deficit Δ_{n,p} := 1/2 - w_{n,p}.
  We give the basic definition and its consequences derived from earlier results
  (Δ = 0 at p = 1/2, Δ < 0 for p > 1/2). The full perturbation expansion in
  δ = 1/2 - p (Propositions 4.4–4.9, Theorem 4.10) is left for future work.
